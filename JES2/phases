Input Phase: JES2 accepts the job's Job Control Language (JCL) and stores it in spool data sets.

Conversion Phase: JES2 analyzes and converts the JCL into a format that both JES2 and the system's initiators can process. If errors are found, the job is queued for output processing; otherwise, it's queued for execution.

Processing Phase: JES2 selects jobs from the execution queue and assigns them to initiators, which allocate the necessary resources and execute the job.

Output Phase: After execution, JES2 manages the job's output, queuing it for printing or other disposition based on specified parameters.

Print/Punch Phase: JES2 processes the output, directing it to the appropriate device or destination.

Purge Phase: Once all processing is complete, JES2 releases the resources associated with the job, removing it from the system.


Job Submission
When you type SUBMIT (or SUB) on the ISPF editor's command line while editing a JCL file, or use the SUB primary command, z/OS reads the JCL and sends it to JES2 or JES3 for processing.
The job is sent to the Internal Reader, which is a special system facility that allows jobs to be submitted programmatically.

2. Job Enters the JES Queue
JES (Job Entry Subsystem), usually JES2 or JES3, takes control of the job.
JES assigns a Job ID (e.g., JOB00123) and places it in the Input Queue.
JES performs initial syntax checks on the JCL to detect immediate errors before execution.

3. JCL Conversion and Interpretation
The job moves from the Input Queue to the Conversion Queue, where:
The system interprets JCL statements.
JES expands procedures (PROCs) and symbolic parameters.
JES2 converts the JCL into an internal format for execution.
The JES interpreter checks for any syntax errors.

4. Execution Queue
If there are no errors, the job moves to the Execution Queue, where:
The Job Scheduler determines which system resources are required (CPU, I/O, datasets, initiators, etc.).
The job waits for an available initiator, which is a system process that handles job execution.
When an initiator picks up the job, it runs the Job Steps (each step executes a program, such as a COBOL program or a utility like IDCAMS).

5. Job Execution (JES2 manages it with an Initiator)
The initiator runs the job step by step.
Each step executes a program or utility as defined in the JCL.
JES handles input/output requests, manages datasets, and interacts with the system.

6. Output Processing
When execution is complete, the job moves to the Output Queue.
JES collects the SYSOUT (output spool) for any messages, logs, or reports generated by the job.
The output is sent to:
The SPOOL (System Output Queue) for review in SDSF or JES2/JES3 panels.
A printer or dataset, if specified.
A TSO user or another job, depending on job routing.

7. Job Completion and Purging
After execution:
The job logs execution details in SPOOL (viewable in SDSF, ST command).
The job output is stored temporarily for review.
Once reviewed or printed, the job is purged from the system.


Summary of the JES2 Flow
1️⃣ ISPF Editor → Submit Job
2️⃣ JES Input Queue → Initial processing
3️⃣ JES Conversion Queue → Expands JCL, checks syntax
4️⃣ JES Execution Queue → Waits for an available initiator
5️⃣ Job Execution → Runs job steps
6️⃣ JES Output Queue → Stores SYSOUT and job logs
7️⃣ Job Completion → Output is reviewed or printed, then purged
