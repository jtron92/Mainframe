YOU GOTTA CHANGE THE OPEN I-O IFILE TO 

OPEN OUTPUT IFILE


You're opening the file in I-O mode (read and write), but your dataset (CUSTDDI) probably doesn't exist yet â€” or it's not opened with DISP=OLD/SHR in JCL.

When you use OPEN I-O, the file must already exist physically. Otherwise, COBOL raises that logic error with no FILE STATUS to catch it, unless you define error handling explicitly.
