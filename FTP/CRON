✅ GOAL: Run scripts automatically without needing to manually trigger them
🔹 1. Opened the crontab editor

In your Linux terminal:

crontab -e

This opened the user's personal crontab for scheduling tasks.
🔹 2. Chose the editor (first time only)

It asked:

Select an editor. To change later, run 'select-editor'.
1. /bin/nano        <---- easiest
2. /usr/bin/vim.tiny
3. /bin/ed

You typed 1 and hit Enter.

✅ This opened the nano editor for crontab.
🔹 3. Added two scheduled tasks

Inside the crontab file, we added these lines:

* * * * * /home/jtron/send_email_if_exists.sh
*/1 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /home/jtron/gmail_to_zos.py

What they do:
Script	Purpose	Frequency
send_email_if_exists.sh	Checks if email.txt exists and sends it via Postfix	Every minute
gmail_to_zos.py	Checks Gmail for new messages and FTPs them to z/OS	Every 1 minute
🔹 4. Fixed typos (like pytho n3)

We spotted and corrected:

    pytho n3 ➝ should be python3

    Also verified that the full path is correct by running:

    which python3

Result: /usr/bin/python3
🔹 5. (Optional) Added logging to debug

To track script output, you could log it like this:

*/1 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /home/jtron/gmail_to_zos.py >> /home/jtron/imap_to_zos.log 2>&1

View logs with:

tail -f /home/jtron/imap_to_zos.log

🔹 6. Saved and exited the crontab

Inside nano:

    Ctrl + O → Save

    Enter → Confirm

    Ctrl + X → Exit

✅ Final Outcome

Both directions now run hands-free:

    Mainframe ➝ Email: via send_email_if_exists.sh

    Email ➝ Mainframe: via gmail_to_zos.py

🧱 STEP 1: Create the JCL that Linux will submit

This is the JCL that runs your REXX (SUBJCL) on z/OS. It triggers the actual submission of the dataset IBMUSER.JCL.INPUT.
🔹 Create this file on Linux:

File path: /home/jtron/submit_subjcl.jcl

Contents:

//AUTOSUB  JOB CLASS=A,MSGCLASS=A,NOTIFY=IBMUSER
//STEP1    EXEC PGM=IKJEFT01,DYNAMNBR=20
//SYSEXEC  DD DSN=IBMUSER.REXX,DISP=SHR
//SYSTSPRT DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSTSIN  DD *
  EX 'IBMUSER.REXX.SUBJCL'
/*

✅ This JCL will:

    Run your REXX script called SUBJCL

    Which will then:

        Read IBMUSER.JCL.INPUT

        Submit it using SUBMIT

        Delete it after

Once this file is in place, you can proceed to Step 2 to build the Linux FTP script that submits it automatically.

Awesome — here’s STEP 2:
🚀 STEP 2: Create the Linux Script That Submits Your JCL via FTP
🔹 Create this file on your Linux machine:

File path: /home/jtron/send_subjcl_job.sh
🧾 Script contents:

#!/bin/bash

ftp -n 192.168.4.150 <<EOF
quote USER IBMUSER
quote PASS YOUR_MF_PASSWORD
quote SITE FILETYPE=JES
put /home/jtron/submit_subjcl.jcl
quit
EOF

🔐 What to update:

Replace:

YOUR_MF_PASSWORD

With your actual z/OS FTP password.
✅ Make it executable:

chmod +x /home/jtron/send_subjcl_job.sh

🔍 Optional: Test manually first

Run:

bash /home/jtron/send_subjcl_job.sh

Then go to SDSF on your mainframe and look for job:

AUTOSUB

You should see it submitted — and its SYSOUT should show your SUBJCL REXX script being executed.

✅ Let me know when that’s working and we’ll move to STEP 3: Automate with cron.

🔥 LET’S GOOOOO!! You’ve just automated Gmail ➝ Linux ➝ z/OS ➝ job submission — and it actually runs without you lifting a finger now. That’s real mainframe orchestration, my friend.
🎉 Here's What You've Built:

    Gmail ➝ send JCL as a message

    Linux ➝ pulls message, writes it to IBMUSER.JCL.INPUT

    Linux Cron ➝ submits submit_subjcl.jcl via FTP

    z/OS ➝ runs SUBJCL REXX to submit the actual job

    Mainframe ➝ executes the JCL

    🔁 All hands-free — no CA7, no Tivoli, no button clicks

✅ Ready for STEP 3?

You can now automate it fully by letting cron run send_subjcl_job.sh every few minutes.

Want to do that now?

Awesome — let’s lock this in 🔐
✅ STEP 3: Automate Submission via cron

This will tell Linux to run your send_subjcl_job.sh script every few minutes, checking for new JCL and submitting it automatically.
🔹 1. Open your crontab

crontab -e

If it asks for an editor, choose option 1 (/bin/nano).
🔹 2. Add this line to the bottom:

*/2 * * * * /home/jtron/send_subjcl_job.sh

This tells cron:

    “Run this script every 2 minutes.”

✅ You can change */2 to:

    */1 → every minute

    */5 → every 5 minutes

🔹 3. Save and exit

In nano:

    Press Ctrl + O to save

    Press Enter

    Press Ctrl + X to exit

🔍 Optional: Add logging

To keep a log of every cron-triggered run:

*/2 * * * * /home/jtron/send_subjcl_job.sh >> /home/jtron/subjcl_cron.log 2>&1

Then check with:

tail -f /home/jtron/subjcl_cron.log
