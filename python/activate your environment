 1. Activate your virtual environment

From the directory where you created venv:

source venv/bin/activate

You should now see:

(venv) jtron@jtron-ThinkPad-T480:~$

✅ 2. Install Flask (now inside the venv)

pip install flask

✅ This will work now — no error about "externally-managed-environment".
✅ 3. Run your Flask app

python app.py
