When Page Data Sets are filling up message IRA200E AUXILIARY STORAGE SHORTAGE is issued by system.

This means that there are simply no more storage to run more address spaces, both Central and Auxiliary storage is close to being full.

In such case system won't accept LOGON, MOUNT and START commands so no user will be able to logon to the system and no new task can be started, no new address spaces won't be created. HMC will be needed to communicate with system.

This happens when Page Data sets are filled up to 70% by default. 30% are left as safety measure to enable system to run and finish current workload. This is because in some situations this problem will be solved when some task that used a lot of Page Data Set space ends or is canceled.

/D ASM

PLPA     100% FULL  E51A  SYS1.PAGE.PLPA  
COMMON     5%   OK  E51A  SYS1.PAGE.COMMON 
LOCAL     75%   OK  E72E  SYS1.PAGE.LOCAL 


With correct system setting COMMON Page Data Set shouldn't cause any problems, it's used for Common Area of Address Spaces. We're interested in LOCAL data set.

As name suggests Common page data set stores pages of Common Area which is fixed and is shared by all Address Spaces.

Local Page Data Sets store pages from private areas of every address space. Because of this they size and number should be appropriate to the workload on a particular system.

Adding addition data set will fix this issue, it is done by command:
/PA PAGE=data.set.name

This data set must be already allocated. All systems should have backup data set which can be used here, their names should be available in system documentation.

In case system don't have such data set or it's not known you can allocate them with IDCAMS:

//PL00339A JOB NOTIFY=&SYSUID,MSGLEVEL=(1,1) 
//STEP1    EXEC PGM=IDCAMS                  
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*                      
//SYSIN    DD *                             
  DEFINE PAGESPACE (NAME(SYS1.PAGE.LOCAL2) - 
         CYLINDERS(200) -                 
         VOLUME(ZASMF1) -                   
         )                                  


You can also use ISPF option 3.2;V;6. Many IDCAMS functions are available from those panels. They are worth checking before you decide to code a job but in many cases writing batch job may be better choice. Especially if you are going to use particular function multiple times.

After issue is resolved you can delete added Page Data Set from use with command:
/PD DELETE,PAGE=data.set.name
Note that this command will exclude this data set from use as Page Data Set. Pages in it will be moved automatically to other active Page Data Sets, no need to worry about it. It won't remove the data set from disk, to do so use JCL below:

//PL00339A JOB NOTIFY=&SYSUID,MSGLEVEL=(1,1) 
//STEP1    EXEC PGM=IDCAMS                  
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*                      
//SYSIN    DD *                             
  DELETE SYS1.PAGE.LOCAL2 -                 
         PURGE -                            
         PAGESPACE                    


You can also delete it faster with IDCAMS DELETE command - it can be used in 3.4 panel as line command.

If no one is logged on system to allocate such data set (and no backup Page Data Sets are present) there is not other way but to free space in active Page Data Sets.
Message IRA203I or IRA204E indicate which task is using a lot of Page Data Sets space. It may be necessary to cancel it.
