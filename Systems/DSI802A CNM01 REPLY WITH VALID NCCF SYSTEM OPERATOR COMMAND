*0004 DSI802A CNM01 REPLY WITH VALID NCCF SYSTEM OPERATOR COMMAND

Usually, you use the following command from a NetView console to stop the SA z/OS Agent:

CLOSE STOP

The instruction causes the NetView component to shut down all operator logins, autotasks, and other started tasks. The instruction likely causes your NetView login to terminate when it is issued.

If the SA z/OS Agent does not shut down, you can issue the following stronger shutdown command by replying to the NetView outstanding WTOR in the following way, where nn is the reply identifier for the WTOR message DSI802A or DSI803A:

R nn,CLOSE IMMED

The following instruction causes the NetView component to abend any tasks conditionally that are not terminated. If the SA z/OS Agent still is not shut down, try the command:

R nn,CLOSE ABEND

The following instruction causes the main NetView address space to abend and terminate. The subsystem address space does not require termination. If you must stop it to clean up after testing, use the following stop command:

P SYSVSSI

If this instruction does not stop the subsystem address space, then leave it running. This address space does not interfere with anything and attempting to stop it more aggressively can cause you to have to restart the system.
