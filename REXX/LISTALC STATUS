1️⃣ Show All Allocated Datasets (Equivalent to LISTALC STATUS)

LISTALC

    This will display all currently allocated datasets in your session.

2️⃣ Find If SYSEXEC is Allocated

LISTALC STATUS

    Check if SYSEXEC is listed in the output. Look for your REXX dataset.

3️⃣ Find If Any Global SYSEXEC is Allocated

LISTA

    This gives a shorter version of LISTALC and may show global allocations.

4️⃣ Check Active TSO Datasets (SYSEXEC and SYSPROC)

TSO ISRDDN

    Inside the ISRDDN interface, scroll through the list and look for SYSEXEC or SYSPROC.
    This shows all datasets dynamically allocated to your session.
