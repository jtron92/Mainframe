allocate file(sysexec) da('IBMUSER.REXX.LIB') SHR REUSE


1️⃣ ALLOCATE FILE(SYSEXEC)

    This tells TSO that you want to allocate a dataset to the SYSEXEC DDNAME.
    SYSEXEC is where the system looks for REXX execs.

2️⃣ DA('IBMUSER.REXX.LIB')

    This is the dataset that will be allocated.
    It must be a Partitioned Dataset (PDS or PDS/E) where your REXX programs are stored.

3️⃣ SHR (Shareable Access Mode)

    This allows other users and jobs to read from this dataset while it is allocated.
    If you used OLD instead, it would lock the dataset for exclusive use.

4️⃣ REUSE

    Ensures that if SYSEXEC is already allocated, it will be reused instead of failing.
