Create a C Source File
Open the OMVS shell using the OMVS command in TSO.

Use an editor to create your C source file. For example:


oedit myprogram.c
This opens the ISPF editor in OMVS. Alternatively, you can use the vi editor:


vi myprogram.c
Write your C code. Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program:

c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World from z/OS!\n");
    return 0;
}
Save and exit the editor.

2. Compile the Program
To compile the C program, you'll use the xlc compiler provided in z/OS. Here's how:

Compile the program:


xlc myprogram.c -o myprogram
myprogram.c is your source file.
-o myprogram specifies the output executable name (you can name it whatever you want).
If the compile is successful, youâ€™ll see no errors, and an executable file named myprogram will be created.

3. Run the Program
Execute your program using:



./myprogram
