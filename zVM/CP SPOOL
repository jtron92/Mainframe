The DIRM REV command makes use of the CP SPOOL command, a powerful feature that enable redirection of
output from one virtual machine’s virtual punch to another’s virtual reader queue.
In this scenario, the output from DIRMAINT is not really a file retrieval action. It demonstrates how
the CP spool facilitates file transfer between virtual machines.

DIRM REV results in your request message being “punched” to the DIRMAINT machine.
This “punched” output is spooled into DIRMAINT’s reader queue. DIRMAINT reads in messages from its
reader, and deterimenes what processing is required.

DIRMAINT then sends the required response back to your virtual machine, by “spooling” its punch device
to direct output to your reader spool queue.

This method illustrates the spool’s versatility beyond handling real unit record devices. It plays a
crucial role in the virtual environment, enabling the seamless transfer of files between virtual
machines through the manipulation of spool queues.
